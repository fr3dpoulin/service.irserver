- Look into a better way to install/enable the irserver-lircd-uinput
  service

- Uninstallation leaving the lircd-uinput server and the udev rule

- Need to provide some configuration options to the user or at the
  very least trigger off the DEBUG env variable to set loglevel.

- Look into the argument of the irserver and see if there is anything
  useful to expose.

- I had to manually hack the mediacenter.rem file to provide uinput
  compatible event name but it would be better to take it straight
  from source package download. Also, need to add more remotes....

- There is an error communication message that appears (which I
  believe comes from the LCDd service) using the irtrans driver so I
  suspect there is an issue with the order of the services that need
  to be looked into.
